# jumper

The sole purpose of this branch is to preserve the work I did setting jumper up to install as a Snap. Jumper is no longer installed nor distributed as an app but the work required is interesting so I'd like to preserve it.

Since it's a Snap file, you install it like this - sudo snap install jumper_1.0.1_amd64.snap --dangerous --classic

Once the Snap is installed, launch the game by running jumper.game from your terminal.
