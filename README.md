# jumper

Alls you need to play it is Electron.. So you'll also need NodeJS because you need NPM to install Electron... shit.

Since it's a Snap file, you install it like this - ``sudo snap install jumper_1.0.1_amd64.snap --dangerous --classic``

Once the Snap is installed, launch the game by running ``jumper.game`` from your terminal.
